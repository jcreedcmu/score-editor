\title{Notes on defining category-like structures}

\section{Motivation}

I am interested in attempting to simplify existing definitions of
(weak) higher-dimensional categories, ideally in such a way that gives some
feeling for {\em why} various associativities, coherences, etc. are
the way they are.

The definition I sketch below leans on only $1$-categorical concepts,
interpreting the structure of a 1-category $\C$ as  encoding the structure of a higher-dimensional
category, call it $\H$. The key ideas are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An object of $\C$ encodes a cell of $\H$ arbitrary dimension.
\item A morphism of $\C$ encodes a way that one cell of $\H$ `sits inside' another cell, e.g. recording that $C$
is situated at the beginning of $f : C \to D$, or that $f$
sits inside a composite $g \circ f$.
\item We will be concerned with special classes of $\C$-morphisms, which encode special kinds of `sitting inside'. These
allow us to require properties of $\C$ that correspond to composition operations in $\H$. For example,
if $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$ and $h : C \to D$ are morphisms in $\H$, then
$1_A$ and $f$ and $g  f$ and $h  g  f$ sit inside $hgf$ ``to the left'', i.e. towards the domain of $hgf$,
 and $1_D$ and $h$ and $hg$ and $hgf$ sit inside $hgf$ ``to the right'', i.e. towards its codomain.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Definition}
\subsection{Minor Preliminaries}
Say an object $C$ in a category is {\em final} if all arrows out of $C$ are split mono.
Observe that terminal objects are final. If $S$ and $T$ are sets and $\star$ a binary operation on their
elements,
we write $S\star T$ for $\{s \star t\st s \in S, t \in S\}$.
\subsection{Warm-up}
In this subsection we're going define a category with extra structure that turns out to be equivalent to the definition of a category,
as a prelude to the more general definition of higher-dimensional structure.

A {\em $\tau_1$-category} is a category $\H$ such that also
\begin{enumerate}
\item There are sets $L, R$ of morphisms of $\H$, which contain all isomorphisms and are closed under composition.
We also write simply $L$ and $R$ for the subcategories induces by these sets of morphisms, taking all the objects of $\H$.
\item Every
$\cdot \stackrel{L}{\longrightarrow} \cdot \stackrel{R}{\longleftarrow} \cdot$
in $\H$ can be completed to
  \[\begin{diagram}
  \cdot&\rTo^{L}&\cdot\\
  \dTo<{R}&&\dTo>{R}\\
  \cdot&\rTo_{L}&\cdot
  \end{diagram}\]
and every such commutative square in $\H$ is a pullback. (The two
$L$-morphisms (resp. $R$-morphisms) in the diagram aren't necessarily
the same morphism, they're just both in the class $L$ (resp. $R$))

\item $(L, R)$ and $(R, L)$ are orthogonal factorization systems
\item For any $H\in \H$ there exists $H \stackrel{d}{\to} D$ (`the domain of $H$') such that
$d$ is the terminal object of the slice category $H/L$, and $D$ is $R$-final.
\item For any $H\in \H$ there exists $H \stackrel{d}{\to} D$ (`the codomain of $H$') such that
$d$ is the terminal object of the slice category $H/R$, and $D$ is $L$-final.

\end{enumerate}
A $\tau_1$-functor is a functor that preserves the $L$ and $R$ sets, and pullbacks, and the choice of domain and codomain morphisms.
\begin{theorem}
The category of (small) categories and the category of (small) $\tau_1$-categories are equivalent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show how to construct categories from $\tau_1$-categories and vice-versa, and
leave it to the reader to verify that they constitute an equivalence.

Let a category $\C$ be given, and we construct $\H$. The objects of
$\H$ are the morphisms of $\C$, and a morphism $f \to g$ (`$g$ sits inside $f$') in $\H$ is a
pair $(h, k)$ such that $f = hgk$. The $L$-morphisms are those of the
form $(h, \rid)$, and the $R$-morphisms are those of the form
$(\rid, k)$.
It's routine to check that (1), (2), (3) are satisfied. For (4), the domain of an object
 $f : C \to D$ of $\H$ is $(f, \rid_C) : f \to \rid_C \in L$, and for (5), the codomain of $f$
is $(\rid_D, f) : f \to \rid_D \in R$.

Let a $\tau_1$-category $\H$ be given, and construct $\C$. The objects of $\C$ are the objects
of $\H$ that are final in both $L$ and $R$. The morphisms $C \to D$ of $\C$ are the spans
$C \stackrel{L}\longleftarrow f \stackrel{R}\longrightarrow D$
\cqed
\end{proof}

\subsection{Taxonomies}
Now let's generalize the pair of sets $L$, $R$ used in the above construction.

A {\em taxonomy} $\tau$ is
\begin{enumerate}
\item a set $K$ of {\em morphism class labels}
\item a ternary relation $\dash \mapsto \dash \o \dash \subseteq K \times K \times K$.
This induces relations  ${\le} \subseteq K \times K$ and
 $\bot \subseteq K \times K$ defined by the following rules:
\[
 \erule{}{k \le k} \qquad \erule{k_1 \le k_2 \qquad k_2 \le k_3}{k_1 \le k_3}
\qquad
\erule{ k \mapsto k_1 \o k_2}{k_1 \le k} \qquad \erule{ k \mapsto k_1 \o k_2}{k_2 \le k}
\]
\[\erule{ k \mapsto k_1 \o k_2\qquad k_1'\le k_1 \qquad k_2'\le k_2}{k_1' \bot k_2'}\]
\item an element $1\in K$ which is $\le$-maximal.
\item a relation $\tri(\dash, \dash, \dash)  \subseteq K \times K \times K$
\end{enumerate}

We say a category $\C$ is a $\tau$-{\em category} when:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each $k \in K$, there is a set $[k]$ of morphisms of $\C$, which contains all isomorphisms and is closed under composition.
\item If $k_1 \le k_2$, then $[k_1] \subseteq[k_2]$. The set $[1]$ is all morphisms of $\C$.
\item If $k_1 \bot k_2$, then every
$\cdot \stackrel{k_1}{\longrightarrow} \cdot \stackrel{k_2}{\longleftarrow} \cdot$
in $\C$ can be completed to
  \[\begin{diagram}
  \cdot&\rTo^{k_1}&\cdot\\
  \dTo<{k_2}&&\dTo>{k_2}\\
  \cdot&\rTo_{k_1}&\cdot
  \end{diagram}\]
and every such commutative square in $\C$ is a pullback.
\item If $k \mapsto k_1 \o k_2$, then $([k_2], [k_1])$ is an
orthogonal factorization system in $[k]$.
\item If  $\tri(k_1, k_2, k_3)$, then for any $C\in \C$ there exists $C \stackrel{d}{\to} D$
that is the terminal object of $C/([k_2] \o [k_1])$, and $D$ is $[k_3]$-final.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Examples}
We can define a taxonomy, call it $\tau_1$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $K = \{1, L, R\}$.
\item $1 \mapsto L\o R$ and $1 \mapsto R \o L$
\item  $\tri(L, L, R)$ and $\tri(R, R, L)$
\end{enumerate}

\noindent This leads to the same definition of $\tau_1$-category as above.

\noindent Let's define another taxonomy, call it $\tau_\omega$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $K = \{L_n, R_n, E_n, G_n \st n \in \N^+\}$ with
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $E_n \mapsto L_n\o R_n$
  \item $E_n \mapsto R_n \o L_n$
  \item $G_{n} \mapsto E_n \o G_{n+1}$
  \end{enumerate}
 (note that $G_1$ is the required $\le$-maximum element)
\item  $\tri(G_{n+1}, L_n, R_n)$ and $\tri(G_{n+1}, R_n, L_n)$
\end{enumerate}

The intuition here is that $L_n$ and $R_n$ are for when one
cell sits inside another solely by composition on the `left' or `right'
side by an $n$-cell. $E_n$ is when you're allowed to compose on both
ends with $n$-cells. $G_n$ is when you're allowed to tack on cells of
dimension $n$ or higher.

\begin{conjecture}
$\tau_\omega$-categories are something like $\omega$-categories??
\end{conjecture}
